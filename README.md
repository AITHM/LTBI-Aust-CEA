Cost Benefit treatment of latent TB

To estimate the latent TB (LTBI) prevalence in Australia, country and year specific annual risk of infection estimates were applied ("Data" folder: tbhaz.200rep.rds, tbhaz.5000rep.rds)
These estimates were created by Pete Dodd and Rein Houben, and are associated with their analysis of the global prevalence of LTBI:
